# Xen-Framework
## Desciption
Xen Framework is an MVC based framework for SFML.
## Why
After three SFML projects I have noticed too problems :
* rewriting resources managers
* Spaghetti code : classes and patterns can be confusing and hard to update.

This Frameworks is here to help myself and other developers to manage SFML projects.
It will take care about resources managing and gives you few tools like event listeners, services, ..
## Requires
* SFML - Multimedia API (2.X)
* CMake (>= 2.6)
## TODO
Still work in progress many things must be added

1. Core :
* Resources Loaders/Handlers
* XML support
* Event Listeners
* Services

2. Config :
* lod files
3. src :
* MVC pattern
